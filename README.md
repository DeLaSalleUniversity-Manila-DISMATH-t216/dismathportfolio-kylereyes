Week 1:
</br>
+ I learned what are propositions. Propositions are sentences that declares a fact that is either true or false.
+ I learned that proposition has operations like the negation is the NOT in the logic circuits, conjuntion is the AND, disjunction is the OR and exclusive or is XOR.
+ I learned that propositions can be combinded using conditional statement. The conditional statement is like a promise like our prof said. The example that the prof has given us  is that "If you get a 100% in the finals, the prof will give us a 4.0 grade" in the example if we get a 100% in the finals then we will get a 4.0 grade then both statements are true but the 2nd statement can also be true even if we don't get a 100% in the finals.
+ I learned that there are different kinds of conditional statements. These are Converse, Contrapositive and Inverse
+ I learned that there is also a biconditional statement where the given p ↔ q. The statement can only be true if p → q are true and q → p are also true. both statements should be true for biconditional statement to be true.

Week 2:
</br>
+ I learned about compound propositions. there are the Tautology which is always true, Contradiction which is always false and Contingency which is nether true nor false.
+ I learned about the logical equivalence. there are the Identity Laws, Domination Laws, Indepotent Laws, Double negation Law, Commutative Law, Associative Law, Distributive Law, De Morgan's Law, Absorption Law and Negation Law. There are also logical equivalences involving condtional and biconditonal statements.
+ I learned about Quantifiers. There are the Universal quantifier which is "for all" where it is true if all are true and Exixtential quantifier which is "there exist" where it is true if there is one  true.
+ I learned about the Rules of Inference. There are Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction and Resolution.

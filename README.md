Week 1:
</br>
+ I learned what are propositions. Propositions are sentences that declares a fact that is either true or false.
+ I learned that proposition has operations like the negation is the NOT in the logic circuits, conjuntion is the AND, disjunction is the OR and exclusive or is XOR.
+ I learned that propositions can be combinded using conditional statement. The conditional statement is like a promise like our prof said. The example that the prof has given us  is that "If you get a 100% in the finals, the prof will give us a 4.0 grade" in the example if we get a 100% in the finals then we will get a 4.0 grade then both statements are true but the 2nd statement can also be true even if we don't get a 100% in the finals.
+ I learned that there are different kinds of conditional statements. These are Converse, Contrapositive and Inverse
+ I learned that there is also a biconditional statement where the given p ↔ q. The statement can only be true if p → q are true and q → p are also true. both statements should be true for biconditional statement to be true.
